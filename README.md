Amplio BLE-RaspberryPi Indoor Positioning System

In this project we develop a Bluetooth Low Energy Indoor Positioning System using Python.
Smartphones act as beacons and with Raspberry Pi we catch the signal advertised by the smartphones and calculate distances.
This way we estimate the closest pi and send data to the PLC to work further.
